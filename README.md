# Data Visualization 

### Abstract 

A personal project over a winter break to learn python's pandas and matplotlib libraries used for data visualization. 
See the document below for the most interesting visualizations. For the source code to generate these visuals, please 
see the respective jupyter notebooks.

**Top Ten Sources of Remittances from 2010-2016:**

Which countries send the most money in terms of remittances? When we plot a stackplot, we see that the United States has for the entire period make up a large, though increasingly declining percentage of the remittances sent home. Over time, other countries, such as China and Saudi Arabia now make up a larger share of the remittances sent.

**Developer Salaries, Languages, and Age in 2019:** 

What is the relationship between developer salaries, programming languages, and age in 2019? According to the 2019 Stack Overflow developer survey, salaries generally grew with age and Python programmers earned slightly more than the average developer.

**Average Developer Age:**

What is the average age of a developer in 2019? Are we correct in assuming that programming is a young person's business? When we plot a histogram, we see that indeed there are far more young developers and that programmers in middle age and beyond are relatively rare.
