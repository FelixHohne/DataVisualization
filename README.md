**Top Ten Sources of Remittances from 2000-2016:**

Which countries send the most money in terms of remittances? When we plot a stackplot, we see that the United States has for the entire period make up a large though increasingly declining percentage of the remittances sent home. Over time, other countries such as China and Saudi Arabia now make up a larger share of remittances sent.

**Developer Salaries, Languages, and Age in 2019:** 

What is the average age of a developer in 2019? Are we correct in assuming that programming is a young person's business? When we plot a histogram, we see that indeed there are far more young developers and that programmers in middle age and beyond are relatively rare.

Considering that most programmers are relatively young, what is the relationship between developer salaries, programming languages, and age in 2019? According to the Stack Overflow developer survey, salaries generally grew with age, while Python programmers earned slightly more than the average developer.
