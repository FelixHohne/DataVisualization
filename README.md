**Top Ten Sources of Remittances from 2000-2016:**

Which countries send the most money in terms of remittances? We see that the United States has for the entire period make up a large though increasingly declining percentage of the remittances sent home. Over time, other countries such as China and Saudi Arabia now make up a larger share of remittances sent.

**Weather and Traffic Accidents:**

During what type of weather are traffic accidents most common in the United States? We might naively assume most traffic accidents occur during bad weather, but this is not the case; traffic accidents are actually most common during clear weather.

**Parental Education and and Marriage Rates:**

What is the relationship between the level of education and the rate at which couples are married when they have a child? As modern Social Science has led us to expect, the approximately 3.8 million births in the United States in 2018 clearly indicate that parental education is generally though not perfectly correlated with the rate of marriage. 

Due to space limitations, I used shorthand for each level of education. Here is the key: 

+ N/A: Less than 8th grade
+ HS-: HS Dropout
+ HS: HS Diploma  
+ AA-: Some College
+ AA: Associates Degree
+ BA: Bachelor's Degrees
+ MA: Master’s degree
+ Ph.D.: Doctorate or Professional Degree

**Developer Salaries, Languages, and Age in 2019:** 

What is the average age of a developer in 2019? Are we correct in assuming that programming is a young person's business? When we plot a histogram, we see that indeed there are far more young developers and that programmers in middle age and beyond are relatively rare.

Considering that most programmers are relatively young, what is the relationship between developer salaries, programming languages, and age in 2019? According to the Stack Overflow developer survey, salaries generally grew with age, while Python programmers earned slightly more than the average developer.
