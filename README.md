**Top Ten Sources of Remittances from 2000-2016:**

Which countries send the most money in terms of remittances? We see that the United States has for the entire period make up a large though increasingly declining percentage of the remittances sent home. Over time, other countries such as China and Saudi Arabia now make up a larger share of remittances sent.

**Weather and Traffic Accidents:**

During what type of weather are traffic accidents most common in the United States? We might naively assume most traffic accidents occur during bad weather, but this is not the case; traffic accidents are actually most common during clear weather.

**Parental Education and and Birth Weight**

Considering the high level of inequality of inequality in the United States, could there now perhaps be a relationship between the level of parental education and the birth weight?

**Developer Salaries, Languages, and Age in 2019:** 

What is the average age of a developer in 2019? Are we correct in assuming that programming is a young person's business? When we plot a histogram, we see that indeed there are far more young developers and that programmers in middle age and beyond are relatively rare.
